I have successfully migrated backend architectures to modern frameworks using NestJS and Microservices, enhancing scalability and performance. My expertise extends to developing and maintaining robust applications with Angular, .NET, and SQL. I am also well-versed in CI/CD processes, having utilized Jenkins and GitHub Actions to streamline development workflows. Throughout my career, I have excelled in Agile Scrum environments, collaborating effectively with teams to deliver high-quality solutions.',
            paragTwo: 'In my previous roles, I have led efforts to turn specifications into actionable tasks, advocating for clean, maintainable code and thorough documentation. I have integrated tools such as for mailing and images, implemented microservices architectures with tools like Netflix Eureka and Zuul, and established CI/CD pipelines with Docker and Jenkins. My proactive approach includes mentoring junior developers and contributing to open-source projects. I have also experimented in self continuous learning such as a delivery platform and a newsletter system for healthy recipe recommendations, demonstrating my ability to learn-fast and innovate in dynamic, fast-paced environments.',
