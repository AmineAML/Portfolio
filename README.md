- On Samsung browser the videos does not display (on hover), Also on Avast secure browser is the same, better solution is acquired
- Note: from chrome -> network, check that data transfered explains why hovering over a project doesn't display it video directly meaning that it doesn't load it with ngOnInit which make website loading fast and good
